# graphiql-explorer-ws

Extracted from the [gatsby-graphiql-explorer] package in [gatsby-js/gatsby].

The intent is to add support for [subscriptions-transport-ws], and for
the js entrypoint to be configurable for use-cases outside of gatsby
(for the script be included and initialized manually in standalone `index.html` files).
